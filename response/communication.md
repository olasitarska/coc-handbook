# Communication & reporting

### Communicate with the alleged harasser about the complaint
As soon as possible, either before or during the above meeting, let the alleged harasser know that there is a complaint about them, let them tell someone their side of the story and that person takes it into the meeting.

### Communicate with the harasser about the response
As soon as possible after that meeting, let the harasser know what action is being taken. Give them a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the action stands. "If you'd like to discuss this further, please contact XYZ, but in the meantime, you must something something"

### Communicate with the victim about the complaint
After action has been taken, communicate with the victim to let them know about your decision and sanctions made towards the harasser.

### Report the incidents to the DSF Code of Conduct committee
It’s important to make sure that the DSF’s Code of Conduct committee is aware that an incident happened. This helps to detect common patterns, and makes everyone safe.

After the event, send a separate email to the conduct@djangoproject.com for each incident that took place. Example report:

    When: Date, time
    Where: Conference party at Django* conference
    What happened:
    *insert name* overheard one of our attendees (later identified as *insert name*) speaking to his friends and saying something along the lines of "*insert quote*". The reporter went to this person on quietly asked them to tone it down. They got very confrontational (not physically) and insisted that it wasn't actually inappropriate. It was reminded him that our CoC applies but that didn't really stop them.

    The conference staff decided to talk to this person the next day.
    So on *day*, *name of the people* took him aside to an empty room and went over what happened, explaining our stance on the issue and the reason why we don't accept it.
    The harasser immediately apologized on their own (without any prompt from us). They said that after thinking on it, they realized fully how their behavior was wrong and they thanked us for stepping in.
    The whole meeting lasted about 10 minutes, was very calm and overall successful.

    The conference staff decided not to take any further action and consider the case closed. We are forwarding this report to this board to keep a trace of it in the case of a repeated event in the past or future. We do not expect you to act on this, only to acknowledge the receipt of this report.

### Make an internal report
It’s important to internally (among your conference staff) to keep track of incident handling reports, so we can early detect patterns of behaviour, or keep attendees safe by not allowing harassers who were warned multiple times to attend the event.

Each event should have a central Google Spreadsheet to gather report incidents. The data stored in the spreadsheet should be brief, and include following details:
- Who reported the incident? Name and email.
- Who received the report, and was handling the incident? Names and emails of conference staff members.
- When & where the incident took place.
- Brief details of the incident -- what happened? Don’t go into detail, something like “behaviour after use of alcohol made another attendee feel uncomfortable” is enough.
- Describe action taken by conference staff.
- Who else know about the incident? Was it reported to the DSF?
