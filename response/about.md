# Responding to reports

Ok, so you received a Code of Conduct incident response. Now is your time to take action.

You should aim to take action as soon as reasonably possible. 

Ideally, the points 1-7 from the process should be completed within the next half-day if incident happens during an event. After the event you may need more time to gather sufficient decision makers, but responding within the same week or sooner is good.
