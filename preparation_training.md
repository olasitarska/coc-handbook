# Preparation & training

## Be prepared
It’s important to prepare yourself and your team -- this will give you confidence to handle any issues without unnecessary stress.

- Make sure it’s clear to everyone in the organization team who are the people responsible for receiving the incident reports (“Code of Conduct Team”). This should be ideally a team of two people, a man and a woman.
- Make sure it’s clear to everyone in the organization who is responsible for handling incidents -- from taking the initial report, through making a decision and informing everyone of the action taken. This should ideally be the Code of Conduct Team, and the Conference Chair (or Chairs). Keep this group small.
- Make sure everyone in your team is aware of the procedure outlined here, and knows how to proceed if needed.
- Before the conference, send your list of attendees to the Django Software Foundation committee and other Django events organizers to help you spot potential risks (people who have harassed or created a problem before). Proceed with this guideline if needed.

## Training
It’s important that conference volunteers in different roles are trained in how to handle Code of Conduct incidents and what to do when one occurs. These tips can be helpful:

- Conduct a meeting with all volunteers to brief them on the policies and what they need to know.
- Consider having some role-playing to help people practice responding to people who disclose a Code of Conduct violation. Giving people a chance to practice what they would say can be really helpful for them, and also ensure that anyone who discloses a Code of Conduct violation has a positive experience.
- Create a one-page flyer to be kept at the registration desk with the contact information of the Code of Conduct team and the Conference Chair, important emergency numbers, and basic guidelines that volunteers should follow. Having a checklist is helpful in stressful situations.

## Known harasser registered to the event

- If the person who registered for your event was banned from attending Django* events, cancel their ticket, refund the payment and send an email saying that this person is not welcome on any Django related events.
- If the person is known to you as harasser, and you don’t feel comfortable having them on your event, send them an email offering a full refund.
- If the person is known to you as harasser, but you feel it’s okay for them to attend, keep a close eye and/or have a chat with this person on the first day of the conference, saying that you hope that they’re aware of the Code of Conduct during the event and events surrounding the conference.
